# Grace Hopper Museum Site
This site was created for Grimby to display facts about Grace Hopper to her class.

Grace is actually a very interesting individual, see [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper)

This site was built using jquery and Brunch, also the trusty skeleton.css

### Brunch + Babel/ES6

This is a modern JS skeleton for [Brunch](http://brunch.io).

### Installation

Clone this repo manually or use `brunch new dir -s brunch/with-es6`

### Getting started

* Install (if you don't have them):
    * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org): `brew install node` on OS X
    * [Brunch](http://brunch.io): `npm install -g brunch`
    * Brunch plugins and app dependencies: `npm install`
* Run:
    * `brunch watch --server` — watches the project with continuous rebuild. This will also launch HTTP server with [pushState](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history).
    * `brunch build --production` — builds minified project for production
* Learn:
    * `public/` dir is fully auto-generated and served by HTTP server.  Write your code in `app/` dir.
    * Place static files you want to be copied from `app/assets/` to `public/`.
